# Sparta Boostrap Homework

### Task

1. Create a uniform navbar and and footer for each page to keep the pages consistent.

2. Use bootstrap to build a professional website

### Subject of site

Website modelled after [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com).

### Link to the Github URL

**[https://github.com/kenl94/sparta-custom-bootstrap](https://github.com/kenl94/sparta-custom-bootstrap)**

### How to Download

You would git clone the project with a SSH Key or as a ZIP.
In terminal, clone the project into your directory via the command 
<br/>**'git clone: https://github.com/kenl94/sparta-custom-bootstrap.git'**

### Challenges

We had an issue with the SVG logo in a navbar

We also had to solve a styling issue in the index page, where the mobile view would resolve with the second paragraph appearing above the second image instead of below it. 

### Snippets of our code

**Jumbotron on the home page**

```html
  <!-- Jumbotron Row Div -->
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="jumbotron backgroundindeximg col-md-12">
        <!-- <img src="https://c1cleantechnicacom-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2017/01/Tesla-Model-3-red.png" alt="Tesla Car Image"> -->
        <h1 class="jumbotext">Tesla, Inc. </h1>
		</div>
   	 </div>
   </div>
```
